HOW THE GAME WORKS

 - simple game where you control a ship
 - obstacles are generated at random points on the screen with 2s warning (sprite?)
 - obstacles move at a given speed , let's say 1st obstacle moves at speed 1
 - if obstacles hit border of screen then they get bounced off.
 - after 4? bounces the obstacle disappears
 - an obstacle is generated every 5? seconds at a random point. For nth obstacle,
   the obstacle moves at speed n.
 - score = no. of obstacles vanished
 - if the ship touches the obstacles, game over - score is shown and restarted.
 - high score is kept track of


POTENTIAL FOR IMPROVEMENTS

 - obstacle generation can be an animated sprite/different projectile
 - if you hit e.g. level 5, then ship is upgraded to a bigger one
 - change background upon level up
 - ensure obstacle generation is ?? distance away from ship
 - randomize angle/trajectory of each obstacle
 - add more health to the spaceship and keep track of health
